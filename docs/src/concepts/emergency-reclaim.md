# Emergency Reclaim (Process-Match Kill Switch)

**Status:** Shipped — trigger contract, node-side agent (both rung 1 `/proc` poll and rung 2 netlink proc connector), CRD field, controller-side `EmergencyRemove` dispatch, and opt-in DaemonSet are all live. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/finos/5-spot/blob/main/docs/roadmaps/5spot-emergency-reclaim-by-process-match.md) for the full design and the per-phase ship dates.

## Why emergency reclaim exists

`ScheduledMachine` is built for **time-based** scheduling: a workstation joins the cluster at 9 AM, leaves at 5 PM, next morning it joins again. That model assumes the human owner of the machine does not need it back *right now* — they'll get it back at the next schedule boundary.

Real-world usage breaks that assumption. When a developer whose workstation doubles as a cluster node opens IntelliJ or fires up a JVM, the schedule is irrelevant: they want the box back **immediately**. Waiting for the next schedule boundary — or even a graceful drain (tens of seconds to minutes) — is unacceptable while the user is staring at a spinning JVM startup and the cluster is eating their cores.

Emergency reclaim is the **nuclear eject path**: a node-side agent watches for a user-declared set of process names / argv patterns, and on first match, rips the node out of the cluster as fast as physically possible.

## Two kill switches, one family

5-Spot ships **two** emergency-remove mechanisms. They share the same "skip graceful drain, eject now" semantics but differ in who pulls the trigger:

| Mechanism | Trigger | Phase | Side effect | Reset |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **`spec.killSwitch: true`** | Operator edits the `ScheduledMachine` | `Terminated` | None — machine stays terminated until operator resets | Operator sets `killSwitch: false` |
| **`spec.killIfCommands: [...]`** (this page) | Agent on the node sees a matching process | `EmergencyRemove` | Controller flips `spec.schedule.enabled=false` so the machine does not auto-rejoin at the next schedule boundary | Operator (or the user whose workstation it is) sets `schedule.enabled: true` — see [User-facing re-enable flow](#user-facing-re-enable-flow) below |

Both are opt-in: `killSwitch` defaults to `false`, and `killIfCommands` is absent by default (no agent installed on the node).

```

Each hop's responsibility stays narrow: the **agent** only writes annotations (node-scoped RBAC, no broad API access); the **controller** owns all cluster-mutating work (drain, Machine delete, schedule flip).

---

## Lifecycle — where `EmergencyRemove` fits

The new phase plugs into the existing `ScheduledMachine` state machine as a branch off any "alive" phase:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending: Resource created

    Pending --> Active: Schedule active & resources created
    Pending --> Inactive: Outside schedule window
    Pending --> Disabled: schedule.enabled = false

    Active --> ShuttingDown: Schedule ends
    Active --> Terminated: killSwitch = true
    Active --> EmergencyRemove: killIfCommands match on node
    Active --> Error: Provisioning error

    Pending --> EmergencyRemove: killIfCommands match on node
    ShuttingDown --> EmergencyRemove: killIfCommands match on node

    ShuttingDown --> Inactive: Grace period complete
    ShuttingDown --> Error: Shutdown error

    Inactive --> Active: Schedule window starts
    Inactive --> Disabled: schedule.enabled = false

    Disabled --> Pending: schedule.enabled = true

    Terminated --> Pending: killSwitch = false

    EmergencyRemove --> Disabled: Eject complete<br/>(schedule.enabled auto-flipped to false)

    Error --> Pending: Recovery / Retry

    note right of EmergencyRemove
        Non-graceful eject in progress
        gracefulShutdownTimeout ignored
        nodeDrainTimeout ignored
    end note

    note right of Disabled
        Exit path from EmergencyRemove.
        User sets schedule.enabled=true
        to return the node to service.
    end note
```

### Why the exit is `Disabled`, not `Pending`

This is the piece that makes emergency reclaim useful instead of infuriating. When the eject completes, the controller **sets `spec.schedule.enabled=false`** on the owning `ScheduledMachine`. Without that flip:

1. Eject succeeds, node leaves cluster.
2. Next schedule window opens (e.g. 9 AM the next morning).
3. Controller sees "in-schedule, no machine exists" and re-creates the Machine → node rejoins.
4. User's JVM is still running.
5. Agent sees match → annotates → controller ejects again.
6. Loop repeats every schedule window forever.

By flipping `enabled=false` the controller makes the user's explicit re-enable the trigger to return the node to service — which is the behavior a human actually wants.

## Sequence of operations

    participant Proc as /proc
    participant Agent as 5spot-reclaim-agent<br/>(DaemonSet pod)

    Note over Agent: First match wins —<br/>no retry loop, no wait<br/>for "reclaim complete"
    Agent->>NodeObj: PATCH metadata.annotations<br/>5spot.finos.org/reclaim-requested=true<br/>5spot.finos.org/reclaim-reason=...<br/>5spot.finos.org/reclaim-requested-at=...
    Agent->>Agent: Exit 0 (idempotent)

    Ctrl->>NodeObj: Watch event: Node updated
    Ctrl->>Ctrl: node_reclaim_request(node)<br/>= Some(ReclaimRequest)
    Ctrl->>SM: status.phase = EmergencyRemove<br/>Emit Event (reason: EmergencyReclaim)

    Ctrl->>NodeObj: kubectl drain<br/>--grace-period=0 --force<br/>--disable-eviction
    Ctrl->>Machine: Delete (immediate)
    Machine-->>Ctrl: Deletion confirmed

    Ctrl->>SM: PATCH spec.schedule.enabled = false<br/>Emit Event (reason: EmergencyReclaimDisabledSchedule)
    Ctrl->>NodeObj: Clear reclaim annotations<br/>(merge-patch with null values)

    Ctrl->>SM: status.phase = Disabled
    Note over Ctrl,SM: Node stays out of cluster.<br/>User manually re-enables when ready.
```

**Why this ordering matters:**

- **Annotations are cleared last**, not first. If the user reboots or the agent restarts mid-eject, the annotation is still there, so the controller keeps processing — the operation is idempotent.
- **`schedule.enabled=false` is set *before* annotation clear.** This is the load-bearing step. If we cleared the annotation first and then crashed, the next reconcile would see no annotation, not flip `enabled`, and fall back to normal scheduling.
- **Machine deletion is immediate** (`--grace-period=0`). No PDB respect, no `gracefulShutdownTimeout` wait, no `nodeDrainTimeout` — the whole point is that the user needs their box back *now*.

## Opt-in installation

The reclaim agent is **not** installed on every node. Both gates below must be satisfied for the agent to land on a node:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["ScheduledMachine.spec.killIfCommands<br/>is non-empty?"]
    B["Controller stamps<br/>node label<br/>5spot.finos.org/reclaim-agent=enabled"]
    C["Controller projects per-node<br/>ConfigMap reclaim-agent-&lt;node&gt;<br/>with the killIfCommands list"]
    D["DaemonSet nodeSelector<br/>matches the label"]
    E["Agent pod lands on node<br/>watches its per-node ConfigMap<br/>via the kube API and hot-reloads"]
    F["No agent on this node<br/>(zero footprint)"]

    A -->|yes| B
    A -->|no / empty| F
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E

    style A fill:#c8d8e8,stroke:#4f6d91,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style E fill:#a7d5a7,stroke:#4f6d91,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    style F fill:#d0d0d0,stroke:#666,stroke-width:1px,color:#000
```

**Why two gates:**

- **Node label** (`5spot.finos.org/reclaim-agent=enabled`) — gates scheduling. An operator cannot accidentally install the agent on nodes that have not opted in; the DaemonSet simply will not schedule.
- **Per-node ConfigMap** — gates *behavior*. Even if an agent pod is running, a config with both match lists empty returns `None` every scan and never annotates. This is the secondary safety net: "everyone has the agent installed with empty match list" is made impossible by construction because the operator has to type the patterns into `spec.killIfCommands` to get anything to happen.

For regulated environments, this double-gating keeps the node-side surface proportional to declared intent — and the binary with elevated privileges (`hostPID: true`, reads every pid in `/proc`) never lands on nodes that have not declared they want it.

!!! note "MVP limitation"
    The 2026-04-20 MVP ships the DaemonSet + RBAC but **not** the controller-side label-stamp and per-node ConfigMap projection. Operators who want to try the agent today must label nodes and create the ConfigMap manually. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/finos/5-spot/blob/main/docs/roadmaps/5spot-emergency-reclaim-by-process-match.md#phase-25--opt-in-installation-gated-by-speckillifcommands) for the remaining work.

## Configuring `killIfCommands`

Declare the match patterns on the `ScheduledMachine` spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: 5spot.finos.org/v1alpha1
kind: ScheduledMachine
metadata:
  name: dev-workstation-01
spec:
  schedule:
    daysOfWeek: [mon-fri]
    hoursOfDay: [19-23]       # join after hours
    timezone: America/New_York
    enabled: true

  clusterName: dev-cluster

  # Emergency reclaim: pull this node out the moment the user opens
  # any of these processes. Matched against /proc/*/comm (exact basename)
  # and /proc/*/cmdline (substring).
  killIfCommands:
    - java
    - idea
    - steam

  bootstrapSpec:
    apiVersion: bootstrap.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: K0sWorkerConfig
    spec:
      version: v1.30.0+k0s.0

  infrastructureSpec:
    apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: RemoteMachine
    spec:
      address: 192.168.1.100
      port: 22
      user: admin
      useSudo: true
```

### Matching semantics

| Source | Kind | Example match |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `/proc/<pid>/comm` | Exact basename, case-sensitive, max 15 chars (kernel limit) | `java` matches a process whose comm is literally `java`. Does **not** match `Java` or `java-wrapper`. |
| `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` | Substring of the NUL-separated argv joined with spaces | `idea` matches `/opt/idea/bin/idea.sh -Xmx2g`. Substring is case-sensitive. |

A config with both match lists empty (or `killIfCommands: []`) is **inert** — the agent returns `None` every scan and never annotates. Absent is equivalent to empty.

### Poll interval

The agent polls `/proc` every `poll_interval_ms` (default 250 ms — see `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` in `src/reclaim_agent.rs`). This is the worst-case detection latency on rung 1 (`/proc` poll).

### Detector — rung 1 (`/proc` poll) vs rung 2 (netlink)

The agent ships two detection back-ends. Both produce identical [`Match`](https://github.com/finos/5-spot/blob/main/src/reclaim_agent.rs) values, both go through the same Node-PATCH path; the only difference is the event source.

| Mode | What it does | Latency | Idle CPU | Linux only? | Extra capability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `poll` (rung 1) | Walks `/proc` every `poll_interval_ms` | up to one poll interval (250 ms default) | ~0 (one syscall per pid per tick) | No — works wherever `/proc` exists | None |
| `netlink` (rung 2) | Subscribes to the kernel's [proc connector](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/connector.html) (`PROC_EVENT_EXEC`); kernel pushes one message per `exec(2)` | <10 ms (kernel-pushed) | sleeps until the kernel wakes it | **Yes** — Linux only | `CAP_NET_ADMIN` |

Selection:

```
--detector=auto       # default. Linux → netlink, anywhere else → poll.
--detector=netlink    # force netlink. Errors loudly on non-Linux or
                      # without CAP_NET_ADMIN.
--detector=poll       # force the rung-1 poll loop on any platform.
```

Override at deploy time via `RECLAIM_DETECTOR={auto|netlink|poll}` on the DaemonSet pod.

**Tradeoff.** `netlink` is lower latency and lower idle CPU in steady state. Under heavy-exec workloads (`make -j32`, compile farms) it can be **more** expensive than `poll`, because rung 2 sees every short-lived process whereas rung 1 only sees those that survive to the next tick. If the operator's fleet runs exec storms, pin `--detector=poll` explicitly; otherwise keep the `auto` default.

The DaemonSet manifest grants `CAP_NET_ADMIN` once at the pod level (see `deploy/node-agent/daemonset.yaml`), so an operator switching `--detector=poll → netlink` (or vice versa) does not need to re-roll the pod's security context. The cap is unused on `poll`; the kernel never sees a netlink syscall in that mode.

### Kernel and capability requirements

Rung 1 (`poll`) needs essentially nothing — `/proc` exists on every Linux kernel and the agent already has UID 0 + host `/proc` mount for [other reasons](#opt-in-installation). It also runs unmodified in a non-Linux container if you ever need to (the `Subscriber` constructor reports "unsupported" and the bin falls back automatically when `--detector=auto` is in effect).

Rung 2 (`netlink`) has three runtime prerequisites:

| Requirement | Provided by | What happens if missing |
|---|---|---|
| **Kernel built with `CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS=y`** | Distro kernel build (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, Alpine, Talos, Bottlerocket, Chainguard host kernels — all default `y`) | The netlink socket opens cleanly but the kernel never pushes events. Agent sits idle, never matches. No userspace error to detect this. Diagnose by `zgrep CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS /proc/config.gz` on the host; mitigate by `--detector=poll`. |
| **`CAP_NET_ADMIN` on the agent container** | `deploy/node-agent/daemonset.yaml` `securityContext.capabilities.add: [NET_ADMIN]` | `Subscriber::new()` fails at startup with `EPERM`; the bin exits non-zero and `kubelet` restarts it (crash loop until the cap is granted). `--detector=poll` works without it. |
| **Linux kernel ≥ 2.6.15** | Effectively guaranteed on any cluster you'd actually deploy 5-Spot to (released 2006) | Same as missing `CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS` — silent. |

The cap chain is straightforward:

```
deploy/node-agent/daemonset.yaml
  └─ container.securityContext.capabilities
       ├─ drop: [ALL]                 # default-deny
       └─ add: [NET_ADMIN]            # rung 2 only — rung 1 doesn't use it
```

This is the *only* added capability. UID 0 + host `/proc` + `hostPID` were already required for rung 1 (the agent has to read every process's `/proc/<pid>/{comm,cmdline}` under `hidepid=2`). See [`.trivyignore`](https://github.com/finos/5-spot/blob/main/.trivyignore) for the architectural-necessity rationale on each Trivy / Semgrep finding the configuration trips.

`CAP_NET_ADMIN` is broader than just netlink-connector access — it also grants ability to edit routes, iptables, etc. on the host network namespace. The risk is bounded by:

1. **Opt-in nodeSelector** — the cap is granted only on Nodes labelled `5spot.finos.org/reclaim-agent: enabled`, which the controller stamps only when a `ScheduledMachine` on that Node has a non-empty `spec.killIfCommands`. A cluster that never uses `killIfCommands` never has the cap on any pod.
2. **Single-purpose binary** — the agent has no shell, no exec of children, no remote-control surface. Compromising it requires swapping the binary on disk, at which point an attacker could grant any cap they wanted anyway.
3. **Operator opt-out** — pin `--detector=poll` (env `RECLAIM_DETECTOR=poll`) and the cap is granted-but-unused. Operators with PSA `restricted` profiles or capability allowlists can deploy in this mode and never need the cap.

See the [threat model](../security/threat-model.md#64-reclaim-agent-trust-boundary-tb5) for the full STRIDE table on the reclaim agent.

## User-facing re-enable flow

When the user is ready to return the node to scheduled service:

```bash
kubectl patch scheduledmachine/dev-workstation-01 \
  --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"schedule":{"enabled":true}}}'
```

What happens next depends on whether the matched process is still running:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Disabled: Emergency reclaim complete

    Disabled --> Pending: User sets<br/>spec.schedule.enabled=true

    state matched_check <<choice>>
    Pending --> matched_check: Re-evaluate schedule<br/>+ re-assess reclaim state

    matched_check --> Active: In schedule window<br/>AND matched process gone
    matched_check --> Inactive: Outside schedule window<br/>AND matched process gone
    matched_check --> EmergencyRemove: Matched process still running<br/>→ agent re-fires

    EmergencyRemove --> Disabled: Eject re-runs,<br/>enabled auto-flipped false again

    note right of matched_check
        If user re-enables while
        matched process still runs,
        controller ejects them again.
        Intended feedback: "quit your
        JVM first, then re-enable."
    end note
```

**This is intentional.** Re-enabling with the matched process still running is the controller's way of telling the user: *"Your JVM is still eating the box. Quit it, then re-enable the schedule."*

### Permanently opting out

If the user wants to **permanently** remove the node from the emergency-reclaim path (e.g. they changed their mind about using the workstation as a cluster node), clear `spec.killIfCommands`:

```bash
kubectl patch scheduledmachine/dev-workstation-01 \
  --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"killIfCommands":null}}'
```

This triggers the controller to strip the node label and delete the per-node ConfigMap, which tears the DaemonSet pod off the node. Time-based scheduling resumes as normal.

---

## Observing the emergency-reclaim path

### Kubernetes Events

The controller emits two distinct Events on the `ScheduledMachine`:

| Reason | Emitted at | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `EmergencyReclaim` | Start of `EmergencyRemove` phase | Agent annotation observed; entering non-graceful eject. Event message includes the reason string from the annotation (e.g. `process-match: java`). |
| `EmergencyReclaimDisabledSchedule` | After successful eject, before annotation clear | `spec.schedule.enabled` has been flipped to `false`. Event message tells the operator how to re-enable. |

View them with:

```bash
kubectl describe scheduledmachine/<name> | grep -A 20 Events
```

### Status condition

A condition is written on the `ScheduledMachine` status so that `kubectl get scheduledmachine -o yaml` surfaces *why* the schedule is disabled:

```yaml
status:
  phase: Disabled
  conditions:
    - type: Scheduled
      status: "False"
      reason: EmergencyReclaimDisabledSchedule
      message: "Schedule auto-disabled by emergency reclaim (process-match: java). Re-enable with kubectl patch when ready."
      lastTransitionTime: "2026-04-20T21:45:00Z"
```

Without this condition, a human reading the object a week later would have no way to tell *why* `enabled` is `false` — whether the operator set it manually, whether there was an emergency reclaim, or whether it has always been off.

### Node annotations (transient)

While the eject is in flight, the Node object carries the three reclaim annotations. They are cleared as the last step of the handler, so steady-state shows no trace on the Node. If you catch one mid-eject:

```bash
kubectl get node <node-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}' | jq
# {
#   "5spot.finos.org/reclaim-requested": "true",
#   "5spot.finos.org/reclaim-reason": "process-match: java",
#   "5spot.finos.org/reclaim-requested-at": "2026-04-20T21:45:00Z"
# }
```

The annotation value `"5spot.finos.org/reclaim-requested"` is checked as a strict literal `"true"` — any other value (`"false"`, `"0"`, empty, missing) is treated as not-requested, which avoids partial-write foot-guns.

### Agent logs

Each DaemonSet pod logs at `info` level on match and annotation write. From the host:

```bash
kubectl logs -n 5spot-system -l app=5spot-reclaim-agent --tail=50 | jq
```

---

## What is *not* part of emergency reclaim

These are out of scope — recorded here because operators often ask:

- **Killing the matched process.** 5-Spot never touches the user's process. The user started it on purpose; killing their JVM to "help them get their node back" is the opposite of the contract. Agent sees, signals, exits.
- **"Reclaim only while the process is running" semantics.** Match is a *trigger*, not a *live predicate*. If the user `kill -9`s their JVM after the annotation is written but before the drain completes, the node still gets reclaimed. Partial-eject-and-rollback semantics would make the state machine significantly more complex for no real-world benefit.
- **Cross-node reclaim.** Each agent is scoped to its own node. A user launching Java on node A does not reclaim node B.
- **Auto-resume when the process exits.** See Open Question 6 in the [roadmap](https://github.com/finos/5-spot/blob/main/docs/roadmaps/5spot-emergency-reclaim-by-process-match.md). Explicit re-enable by the user is the MVP choice; revisit only if operator feedback demands it.

---

## Host-identity verification

Before the agent PATCHes any Node with reclaim annotations, it
cross-checks the host's `/etc/machine-id` against the target Node's
`status.nodeInfo.machineID`. Both are populated from the same source
(`systemd-machine-id-setup` on host boot; kubelet on Node registration),
so they agree on a healthy node — and a mismatch is a strong signal
that the agent is about to write to the wrong Node.

### Why

This closes the *modified-DaemonSet → impersonate-victim-Node* path:

1. Without the check, the agent trusts whatever value `NODE_NAME` carries
   (sourced from the downward API: `spec.nodeName`).
2. An attacker with `update daemonsets` in `5spot-system` can override
   `NODE_NAME` to a hard-coded value (e.g. `victim-node`).
3. The agent runs on host A, sees a process match, and PATCHes
   `victim-node` instead of host A — triggering `Phase::EmergencyRemove`
   on a node it has no business reclaiming.

The cross-check makes the impersonation visible: the spoofed Node's
`status.nodeInfo.machineID` belongs to a different host, so the
comparison fails and the agent refuses to write.

The exploit precondition (`update daemonsets`) is cluster-admin in most
clusters, so this is **defence-in-depth** — but the check is cheap and
removes a category of impersonation. Filed as Phase 4 of the
2026-04-25 security audit roadmap.

### Modes

| Mode | Flag / env | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Strict (default)** | `--skip-host-id-check=false` / `SKIP_HOST_ID_CHECK=false` | Read `/etc/machine-id` at startup; fail to start if missing or empty. Before each PATCH, fetch the target Node and refuse if `status.nodeInfo.machineID` does not match. |
| Bypass | `--skip-host-id-check=true` / `SKIP_HOST_ID_CHECK=true` | Trust `NODE_NAME` blindly (pre-Phase-4 behaviour). Use **only** when `/etc/machine-id` is genuinely unavailable: containers without the host file mounted, dev sandboxes, kubelet variants that do not populate `status.nodeInfo.machineID`. |

### How `/etc/machine-id` is exposed

The DaemonSet mounts the host file as a single read-only file (not the
whole `/etc`):

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: host-machine-id
    mountPath: /host/etc/machine-id
    readOnly: true
volumes:
  - name: host-machine-id
    hostPath:
      path: /etc/machine-id
      type: File
```

`type: File` makes kubelet refuse to schedule the pod if the host file
is missing — fail-fast is preferable to silently degrading to skip-check
mode. The agent reads the path from `MACHINE_ID_PATH` (default
`/host/etc/machine-id` when deployed via the manifest).

### What it does NOT defend against

- A compromise that lets an attacker modify *both* the DaemonSet **and**
  the host's `/etc/machine-id` (would require root on the node).
- Kubelet bugs or out-of-band manipulation of
  `Node.status.nodeInfo.machineID`. The kubelet writes this field; if
  the cluster trusts a misbehaving kubelet, identity verification has
  no anchor.

Both gaps are out of scope for a node-side agent; remediating them
requires a stronger node-attestation primitive (TPM-backed identity,
SPIFFE SVIDs, etc.) — not in this controller's scope. A phased design
for closing both gaps (TPM-quoted machine-id → SPIRE `tpm_devid`
attestation → controller-side SVID verification) is tracked in the
`5spot-strong-node-attestation` roadmap.
